## Code Explanation

The code is organized into several functions to handle different aspects of the trading robot. Here's a breakdown of each function:

1. **OnTick()**: This function is called on every tick (price change) and loops through each currency pair in the `CurrencyPairs` array. It sets the optimal settings for the currency pair and checks if the spread is within the allowed range. If it meets the criteria, it executes the scalping strategy for that currency pair.

2. **SetOptimalSettings()**: This function is responsible for setting the optimal settings for each currency pair. The implementation of this logic is not provided in the code and should be developed separately based on specific strategies and indicators.

3. **ExecuteScalpingStrategy()**: This function executes the scalping strategy for a given currency pair. Again, the implementation of this logic is not provided in the code and should be developed separately based on specific trading strategies.

4. **OnInit()**: This function is called during the initialization of the trading robot. It sets the necessary parameters for the robot, such as selecting all symbols, allowing trading, and setting the trade mode to full.

5. **start()**: This is the main program entry point. It initializes the trading robot by calling the `OnInit()` function and starts the trading process by calling the `OnTick()` function.

Please note that the code provided here is a simplified version and does not include the complete logic for setting optimal settings and executing the scalping strategy. It serves as a starting point for developers to build upon and customize according to their trading strategies.
